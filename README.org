An algorithm I ran for my friends wedding to compute the optimal setlist, i.e. the setlist with the minimal number of musician changeovers.

* Results
The algorithm took around 7 seconds. And this time roughly doubles for every song we add. It seems I was very lucky with the number of songs chosen. Had we added like five more songs, this would have been intractable. Of course, when the cost is zero, the players can reshuffle their songs to their hearts desire, all within their miniset.

* Concluding thoughts
The poor trumpet player was not considered in the algorithm. They play on the song tracks containing "*", and this information was simply ignored.
